<h1 align = "center">One-Commander-Dev-Theme</h1>

A theme for [one commander](http://www.onecommander.com) app.
 
Based on this [theme](https://www.deviantart.com/kdr3w/art/Dev-825722799) color palette...
 
Actually, I just recolored "dark theme by Milos Paripovic" to match this theme color palette...
